# Simple Linear Regression Framework

This framework is a minimalistic approach to linear regression, one of the simplest forms of machine learning models. It's designed to demonstrate the core components of a machine learning workflow: data handling, model definition, training, and evaluation.

## Overview

Linear regression models the relationship between a scalar dependent variable \(y\) and one or more explanatory variables (denoted \(X\)). This framework provides a basic implementation of linear regression, including a training loop that adjusts model parameters to minimize a loss function, specifically the mean squared error (MSE) between the predicted and actual values.

## Structure

- **Data Handling**: Assumes data is already loaded into memory as `X_train`, `X_test`, `y_train`, `y_test`.
- **Model Definition**: A simple `LinearRegression` class that predicts outcomes based on input features.
- **Training Loop**: A function `train` that iteratively adjusts the model's weights to minimize the loss.
- **Evaluation**: A function `evaluate` that computes the MSE on a test dataset to assess model performance.

## Usage

1. **Prepare Your Data**: Ensure your dataset is split into training (`X_train`, `y_train`) and test (`X_test`, `y_test`) sets.

2. **Instantiate the Model**:
    ```python
    model = LinearRegression()
    ```

3. **Train the Model**:
    ```python
    train(model, X_train, y_train, learning_rate=0.01, epochs=100)
    ```

4. **Evaluate the Model**:
    ```python
    print("Model evaluation:", evaluate(model, X_test, y_test))
    ```

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- NumPy

This framework is intended for educational purposes and serves as a starting point for more complex machine learning models and applications.
